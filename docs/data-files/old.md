Can format as simple nested links or as grandchild pages. Simple nested links would show the list as it is below, but the sidebar would not show "old/paramTest" or "old/privateSNPs." Keeping them as grandchild pages would maintain both the list below and the sublinks in the sidebar.

Recommend simple nested links for cleanliness of the sidebar, especially when there are more than two sublevels, but the sidebar dropdown might look a little more user-friendly.
